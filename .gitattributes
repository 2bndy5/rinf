# IMPORTANT:

# With default Git settings, Unix-like systems use LF (`\n`) for new lines,
# while Windows uses CRLF (`\r\n`) in local repositories.
# This default behavior is not ideal for a cross-platform project like this one.
# This configuration file ensures consistent LF end-of-line (EOL) characters
# across all platforms when performing `git clone` or related commands.

# Without this file, text files get written with CRLF EOL characters on Windows,
# leading to compatibility issues when publishing the code with `dart pub publish`.
# This issue has already been observed with `.sh` files.

# You can check the current end-of-line characters used in the cloned repository
# with `git ls-files --eol`. Always ensure that all files use LF for new lines
# before publishing to `pub.dev`.
