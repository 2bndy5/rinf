### Flutter for Aesthetics

Flutter provides a mature and efficient ecosystem for building cross-platform graphical user interfaces. It compiles to all six major platforms and offers:

- Declarative UI pattern
- Beautiful widgets
- Hot reload for rapid development
- Dedicated debugging tools
- Comprehensive UI packages

### Rust for Performance

While Dart is excellent for UI, Rust excels in performance-critical tasks. Rust offers:

- 2-40x speed advantage over Dart
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Multi-threading support
- Access to a vast ecosystem of crates
- A highly loved and robust community

### Benefits

- **Easy setup** – Setup takes only a minute or two.
- **Efficient** – Uses native FFI with no webviews, servers, or extra memory copying.
- **Minimal** – No bulky framework, just Flutter and Rust with minimal dependencies.
- **Scalable** – Easily handle hundreds or thousands of message APIs.
- **High-level interface** – No need to modify build files or worry about memory safety.
- **Well maintained** – Automated tests, low dependencies, and clear documentation.
- **Convenient debugging** – No browsers or emulators; Rust logic restarts on hot restart.
- **Reliable** – Backed by strong communities and a simple, future-proof design.
