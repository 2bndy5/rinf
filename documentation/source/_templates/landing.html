        <h4>Flutter for Aesthetics</h4>
        <p>
          While Rust is a powerful language for high-performance native
          programming, its ecosystem for building graphical user interfaces is
          far from being mature. Though Rust already has some GUI frameworks,
          they don't compete with extensive support and smooth development
          experience that Flutter provides. It's only Flutter that compiles to
          all 6 major platforms from a single codebase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flutter is a powerful and versatile framework that has gained immense
          popularity for building cross-platform applications with stunning user
          interfaces. It provides declarative pattern, beautiful widgets, hot
          reload, convenient debugging tools, and dedicated packages for user
          interfaces right out-of-the-box.

        <h4>Rust for Performance</h4>
        <p>
          While Dart excels as an amazing object-oriented language for GUI apps,
          it may not always meet demanding performance requirements, and it may
          lack advanced data manipulation packages. This is where
          <a
            href="https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/dart-vs-rust"
            >Rust</a
          >
          steps in, offering an incredible speed advantage of roughly 2-40 times
          faster than Dart, alongside the ability to leverage multiple threads
          and various crates that get the job done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rust has garnered a devoted following, being

            >the most loved programming language</a
          >
          on Stack Overflow. Rust's simplicity, memory safety, superior
          performance, vibrant community, and robust tooling support contribute
          to its growing popularity and ensures high productivity.

      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h6>Efficient</h6>
        <p>
          All communication occurs solely through native FFI. There are no
          webviews, web servers, hidden threads, or unnecessary memory copying
          that might cause performance overhead. This setup acts as a very thin
          wrapper around Dart and Rust.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h6>Minimal</h6>
        <p>
          This is not a bulky framework that requires you to install so many
          dependencies and use complicated CLI commands. Just focus on your code
          using your preferred Flutter and Rust libraries.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h6>Scalable</h6>
        <p>
          Creating hundreds or even thousands of message APIs between Dart and
          Rust feels smooth and clean. Additionally, you have the flexibility to
          utilize any number of Rust library crates, perhaps including those you
          might have been working on.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h6>High-level interface</h6>
        <p>
          No messing with sensitive build files, no concerns about memory
          safety. Stay with Dart and Rust that you're familiar with.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h6>Well maintained</h6>
        <p>
          Our automated workflows including build tests are always kept passing,
          thanks to the main branch protection rule. Also, the number of
          external dependencies is kept as low as possible and documentations
          are thoughtfully organized.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h6>Convenient debugging</h6>
        <p>
          All the debugging functionalities are provided by default, without the
          need for dealing with browsers or mobile emulators. Also, the whole
          Rust logic is automatically restarted on Dart's hot restart.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h6>Reliable</h6>
        <p>
          Each component is supported by huge communities, ensuring a strong
          emphasis on future safety. You can easily assure your team of
          stability since this framework's underlying concept is fairly simple.
