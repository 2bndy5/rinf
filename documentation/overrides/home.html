    <h2>Reason for the Combination</h2>

        <h3>Flutter for Aesthetics</h3>
        <p>
          While Rust is a powerful language for high-performance native
          programming, its ecosystem for building graphical user interfaces is
          far from being mature. Though Rust already has some GUI frameworks,
          they don't compete with extensive support and smooth development
          experience that Flutter provides. It's only Flutter that compiles to
          all 6 major platforms from a single codebase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flutter is a powerful and versatile framework that has gained immense
          popularity for building cross-platform applications with stunning user
          interfaces. It provides declarative pattern, beautiful widgets, hot
          reload, convenient debugging tools, and dedicated packages for user
          interfaces right out-of-the-box.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="guide-box">
        <img class="lang-icon" src="assets/rust_icon.svg" />
        <h3>Rust for Performance</h3>
        <p>
          While Dart excels as an amazing object-oriented language for GUI apps,
          its non-native garbage collection may not always meet demanding
          performance requirements, and it may lack advanced data manipulation
          packages. This is where
          <a
            href="https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/dart-vs-rust"
            >Rust</a
          >
          steps in, offering an incredible speed advantage of roughly 2-40 times
          faster than Dart, alongside the ability to leverage multiple threads
          and various crates that get the job done.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rust has garnered a devoted following, being
          <a
            href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages"
            >the most loved programming language</a
          >
          on Stack Overflow. Its native performance, thanks to the zero-cost
          abstraction philosophy, ensures high productivity. Many developers
          foresee Rust potentially replacing C++ in the future. Rust's
          simplicity, memory safety, superior performance in various scenarios,
          vibrant community, and robust tooling support contribute to its
          growing popularity.

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h3>Truly easy</h3>
        <p>
          It only takes about a minute or two to fully setup your app. No other
          solution provides this level of convenience.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h3>Efficient</h3>
        <p>
          All communication occurs solely through native FFI. There are no
          webviews, web servers, hidden threads, or unnecessary memory copying
          that might cause performance overhead. This setup acts as a very thin
          wrapper around Dart and Rust.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h3>Minimal</h3>
        <p>
          This is not a bulky framework that requires you to install so many
          dependencies and use complicated CLI commands. Just focus on your code
          using your preferred Flutter and Rust libraries.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h3>Scalable</h3>
        <p>
          Creating hundreds or even thousands of message APIs between Dart and
          Rust feels smooth and clean. Additionally, you have the flexibility to
          utilize any number of Rust library crates, perhaps including those you
          might have been working on.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h3>High-level interface</h3>
        <p>
          No messing with sensitive build files, no concerns about memory
          safety. Stay with Dart and Rust that you're familiar with.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h3>Low-level control</h3>
        <p>
          Though the hard things are kept beneath the surface, you are free to
          modify the underlying logic such as concurrency or debugging features.
          There is no hidden mechanism that prevents your understanding.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h3>Well maintained</h3>
        <p>
          Our automated workflows including build tests are always kept passing,
          thanks to the main branch protection rule. Also, the number of
          external dependencies is kept as low as possible and documentations
          are thoughtfully organized.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h3>Async interaction</h3>
        <p>
          Rust operations will never block Flutter's main thread because they
          are spawned in a separate thread pool.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h3>Convenient debugging</h3>
        <p>
          All the debugging functionalities are provided by default, without the
          need for dealing with browsers or mobile emulators. Also, the whole
          Rust logic is automatically restarted on Dart's hot restart.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="repeated-box">
        <h3>Reliable</h3>
        <p>
          This framework serves as a direct link between Dart and Rust without
          complex code generation mechanisms. Each component is supported by
          huge communities, ensuring a strong emphasis on safety. You can easily
          assure your team of stability since this framework's underlying
          concept is fairly simple.
