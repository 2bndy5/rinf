# Shorthand Command

Now install the shorthand command tool to easily execute Rinf commands in the CLI.

```bash
cargo install rifs
```

After you've installed `rifs`, which stands for 'Rinf Shorthand', you can use this tool to execute any command provided by this framework. Actual commands will be introduced in the upcoming sections.

```bash
rifs ...
```

> All the commands of this framework can originally be executed with `dart run rust_in_flutter ...`. However, this is quite long and cumbersome to write over and over again. That's why this framework provides a shorthand command tool.
