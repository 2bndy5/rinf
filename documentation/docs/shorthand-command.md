# Shorthand Command

Now install the shorthand command tool to easily execute Rinf commands in the CLI.

```bash
cargo install rinf
```

After you've installed the `rinf` executable, you can use this tool to execute any command provided by this framework. Actual commands will be introduced in the upcoming sections.

```bash
rinf ...
```

If you're curious about all the available commands, use the `--help` argument.

```bash
rinf --help
```

> All the commands of this framework can originally be executed with `dart run rinf ...`. However, this is quite long and cumbersome to write over and over again. That's why this framework provides a shorthand command executable.
