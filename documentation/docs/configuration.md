```

You can check the current configuration status by running the command below in the CLI.

## ðŸ“¦ Crate Features

```toml title="native/hub/Cargo.toml"
rinf = { version = "0.0.0", features = ["feature-name"] }
```

- `multi-worker`: Starts a worker thread for each CPU core available on the system within the `tokio` runtime. By default, the `tokio` runtime uses only one thread. Enabling this feature allows the `tokio` runtime to utilize all the cores on your computer. This feature does not affect applications on the web platform.
