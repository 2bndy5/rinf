**"Rust as your Flutter backend, Flutter as your Rust frontend"**

![preview](https://github.com/cunarist/rust-in-flutter/assets/66480156/be85cf04-2240-497f-8d0d-803c40536d8e)

Designed for ease of use, future scalability, and unparalleled performance, this lightweight framework takes care of all the complexity behind the scenes. No messing with sensitive build files, no excessive code generation during development. Simply add this framework to your app project, and you're all set to write Flutter and Rust together!

## üéÆ Demo

Visit the [demo](https://rif-example.cunarist.com/) running on the web to experience the smoothness and delightfulness that comes from the combination of Flutter and Rust.

## üñ•Ô∏è Platform Support

All platforms available with Flutter are [tested](https://github.com/cunarist/rust-in-flutter/actions/workflows/build_test.yaml?query=branch%3Amain) and supported. Challenging build settings are automatically handled by this framework.

## üê¶ Why Use Flutter?

While Rust is a powerful language for high-performance native programming, its ecosystem for building graphical user interfaces is far from being mature. Though it already has some GUI frameworks like `iced`, `egui`, `gtk-rs`, and others, it doesn't compete with extensive support and smooth development experience that Flutter provides. It's only Flutter that compiles to all 6 major platforms from a single codebase.

Flutter is a powerful and versatile framework that has gained immense popularity for building cross-platform applications with stunning user interfaces. It provides declarative pattern, beautiful widgets, hot reload, convenient debugging tools, and dedicated packages for user interfaces right out-of-the-box.

## ü¶Ä Why Use Rust?

While Dart excels as an amazing object-oriented language for GUI apps, its non-native garbage collection may not always meet demanding performance requirements, and it may lack advanced data manipulation packages. This is where Rust steps in, offering an incredible speed advantage of roughly [2~40 times faster](https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/dart-vs-rust) than Dart, alongside the ability to leverage multiple threads and various crates that get the job done.

Rust has garnered a devoted following, being [the most loved programming language](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) on Stack Overflow. Its native performance, thanks to the zero-cost abstraction philosophy, ensures high productivity. Many developers foresee Rust potentially replacing C++ in the future. Rust's simplicity, memory safety, superior performance in various scenarios, vibrant community, and robust tooling support contribute to its growing popularity.
